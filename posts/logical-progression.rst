.. type: text



uhhhh whoops! Looks like I accidentally skinned bootstrap4! 

I'm absolutely **NOT DONE** with customizing this, but I mostly wanted to 
get the theme rolling so I had *SOME* idea of what I wanted to do. The main
objective to be trying to get somewhat close to `my personal site <https://kautumnrain.neocities.org>`_,
which I'd say the theme is pretty close to. 

Next, I'd like to add a sidebar of the most recent posts and an archive 
tree. After that, I'm probably done for awhile.

Let me know what you think about all of this!
