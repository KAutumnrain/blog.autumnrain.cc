.. description: I gotta write SOMETHING, so I'll make this shortish
.. type: text

I'm mostly writing this to take my mind off things.

Tragically, I'm trying to keep my mind off of not getting
an immediate response from an HR dept about some work, since
self-employment didn't treat me all that well. Learning new
things as much as possible is excellent when the job you have
gives any kind of consistent income, which is not how this has gone.

I digress, and will build myself a better future as necessary. 


Nikola's templating system is interesting but I haven't had a huge
amount of time to pick it apart and make my own. Respectfully, 
the documentation could be slightly better, but I admit it is perhaps
a personal failing that I don't exactly understand it immediately.
I intend to draw and plan out my theme and throw it up for those
using Nikola as well, assuming I can get it to my liking. 

With a customizable config, of course.

The automation with actions seems pretty straightforward, but as an eventuality 
I'd like to get this up on an EC2 at some juncture, although staying within 
free-tier is probably impossible (understandably). 

I am still pleased with the move from Substack. Being able to use proper
markdown feels VERY good, and a proper RSS feed is much more appealing
than exploding an inbox. People get enough emails daily as-is. 
I know I do, although I will still subscribe to and read them 
because I like supporting other writers, too. I would like to give
more details on this in the future. I think Substack is trying to be 
many things that it isn't that great at being, and it may tie into
a larger platform-related rant regarding 'everything apps'. 

The comment system I'm using, `utterances <https://utteranc.es/>`_, is still pretty nifty to me. 
I know not everyone has a github, and I am tempted to throw up a contact 
email or something for those that don't partake. We'll see. I definitely
want to throw the effort at it.

I may reuse my favicon or make a new one. My skills over time regarding
2D graphics have definitely improved, and I'd like to make use of them.
They might be stuck in neoy2k-land, but I still find the y2k style super
appealing.

Finally, I have new, actually attainable goals. Personal tragedy can
be the world's greatest humility machine. The Earth is never as far
away as one thinks.
