Check this out!

You may have noticed I have swapped out the theme from `hack <https://themes.getnikola.com/v8/hack/>`_ to
`bootstrap4 <https://themes.getnikola.com/v8/bootstrap4/>`_. 

I'm doing it mostly for ease of customization,
but it's becoming incredibly clear that I may just have to do a pure overhaul of most themes. 
There are huge 'one-liners' of CSS that make it pretty difficult to modify the theme further. 

As such, this will be a temporary theme until I have the time and energy to bring things into my personal
spec. 

Automation-wise, I haven't really worked on that yet either, mostly because it's largely dependent on
me settling on a theme, but I might just go ahead and write the pipeline anyhow, since I have to rebuild
the entire project anyways every time I want to post. 

Like the theme? Don't care for it? Let me know (mostly because some of this theme might end up in the
real semi-permanent one).
