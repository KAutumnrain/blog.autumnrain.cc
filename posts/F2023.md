So, this is it, the end of 2023.

Is that... another post before another month passes us by? Mark *that* on the calendar. Granted, it's short, but too much of what's been going on has been just terribly mundane. 

I have a lot of work ahead of me until New Years' so let me kind of elaborate on the nonsense and we can start working towards the goals, one step at a time.

<!-- TEASER_END -->

### The Past (Month)

I *wanted* to get some kind of music out this month; Unfortunately this is not happening as my creative endeavors have mostly been visual. My partner requested an art piece for the holidays, and thus I obliged and attempted to make it the pinnacle of my recent works. I feel like I did an okay job (that I still want to improve upon) despite the short notice and stress of attempting to make it as good as possible within my skill level, which is still growing the more I do the thing. 

I have picked up some side work for a friend additionally that I cannot speak publicly about, but I'm hoping it leads to something interesting and mentally stimulating. A good time to stretch my reverse engineering skills.

Outside of this, December's been an exhausting affair. I've been sick twice at least and I want to avoid taking too many days off from here on: Things. **Must**. Continue. Moving.

### The Now
I'm pretty much swamped with work until the second week of January where I can start *really* cooking. Focus: get through the rest of the week and then some with my sanity, sleep, etc intact. 

Which pretty swiftly leads me unto...

## The Future

Per [Time Moves Ever Forward](https://blog.autumnrain.cc/posts/tmef/), my primary objectives have not changed. Things must continue. Everything will fit into place; It *has* to, even if the end result is a little scuffed. Look forward to the results of boredom until then, because after this week, a lot of things slow down to a crawl. The latter half of the year is a trial in and of itself, such is the pattern.

Additionally, I am working on a new blog theme that achieves parity with the [Main Site](https://autumnrain.cc), and does so easily with all future versions of it, regardless of whatever iterative properties those versions might contain. This is, however, going to take a hot minute as past blog posts have certainly made clear at this stage. 


### /// REITERATOR
Ultimately, there's something to be said about wanting to be the best person one can be. This year alone was a struggle; The depression, the burnout, the 'generally being too broke to live' shit. 
Now, after the majority of my misery has passed, there's still a lot of work I need to do, but I move forward with vision, purpose, and a sense of self. I have reaffirmed my existence to myself. I must press on, despite the god-awful hand I've been dealt. From all the staring into the void I've done, from all the hard-learned lessons from this personally fucking awful year, I have the following words on offer:

*Become unstoppable, lest you get caught up in the torrential light of crystalline stasis*

Happy New Year.
