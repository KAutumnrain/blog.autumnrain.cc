                    <p>I stand before you, five months after my last post. </p>
<p>In a sense, not much has changed. Things have kept moving.  I've obtained my motorcycle license, I've started talking to someone (an angel of the moon, no less :3), and I've broken free of a false maze. </p>
<p>I remember when I initially built this blog almost a year and a half ago now(!). There hasn't been much posting on it, and it's mostly because as it turns out, I have a life.... and probably ADHD, too.</p>
<p>For updates, I've gone to girlmoding permanently now. My voice betrays me at a moment's notice, my form a work-in-progress, but I will neither crumple nor submit to sleepers' beliefs of whether or not I even exist. </p>
<p>It's not for them to decide.</p>
<p>For better or worse, I've cut down some of my social media presence due to culture clashes. In one of them, I'm out of the age bracket that culture is formulated by, so I'm pushed away by the diaspora therein. It's not that I'm not wanted, it's that I can't provide them much interest, and I'm also not really interested in pure outrage all of the time anyways. However, I also quite dislike getting tone-policed for showing a degree of bitterness around subjects like blatant human rights violations, things affecting trans care, the rising tide of anti-trans rhetoric, et cetera. Talk only works if you can back it up with action and participation; There are precious few who do so, and I've reached a certain limit with those who cannot. If you're on that site, you're still welcome to contact me, but until I can regain my energy and become confident in building a community over there, I'm on hiatus. </p>
<p>I'm still writing my VtM campaign. It's going well, but I've pivoted to writing a one-shot and developing an 'ephemeral codex' for the lore noobs in the group. I intend to introduce the group to Mage down the line, but revealing much more would be spoiler territory for those in it (hi nerds!!! :3). It also makes for fun banter between pulls when we're raiding ("roll me Dex + Martial Arts, nerd!").</p>
<p>The heavy stuff still weighs so. One thing I realize (and friends corroborate) about the burnout, the breakups, the bitterness, is that things don't 'heal' so much as they become easier to navigate. The burnout is mostly gone, now, but I still get the occasional backlash from time-to-time. The bleeding has stopped, but now I have faded scars and emotional soft spots. 
An example presents itself after I told them my upcoming class schedule, where my parents mentioned how little pride I give myself in doing the hard things, and leading through example, and how proud of me they were that I was pushing through everything. I am trying to be my best self; and that self requires that I push back against the tide of people and structures unable, or outright refusing to see me for the woman I am. I don't give myself much praise, but it made me realize, after some tears, that despite my flaws, my neuroses, my mistakes, I can still build something worthwhile. </p>
<p>So I will continue to push back against the six million gallons of ignorance, build the life I want to live, seek the knowledge I hunger for, and advocate for our rights and futures as trans folks. I seek more of our art to hear, see, experience, and feel. I want more of our knowledgebase in my brainspace.
I want our ability to live as ourselves to be secured. 
I will not yield. </p>
<p>Stand your ground, Hold Your Color ❤️</p>

<p>March 31st. International Trans Day of Visibility. </p>
<p>The 15th one, to be precise. </p>
<p>Before we go into the weeds, I want to make a slight callback.</p>
<p>I've mentioned before that I've always wanted to make an <a href="https://blog.autumnrain.cc/posts/encroaching-darkness/">immersive sim</a>, but in that post I felt like I did a bad job of describing what, exactly, preempts me from doing so, outside of the thousands of systems needing to snap in place late into development and the fact that I am one person. </p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that I'm not a great writer. I feel I have no writing voice, especially not for fiction. Yet, I write anyways, inspired by works and authors of the past, in hopes that one day I'll be good enough to make my own stories worth telling. Until then, I'm enamored with the imagery of the scarlet stepped pyramid of the Eastern Seaboard Fission Authority, reminded by the echoes of a linguistic Metavirus, and personally involved in the actual allegorical basis of two different-colored pills in my own way<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="posts/six-seconds/#fn:1">1</a></sup>. </p>

<p>Got a bit of a quick one for you today.</p>
<p>On March 15th, 1999, RSS was initially released to the world on the Netscape.com portal.</p>
<p>Previously, I wrote about RSS as a part of an experiment where I tried to find one cool thing weekly.
I failed at that experiment, but I think it was a good experiment. It's a shame it had to be on substack first.</p>
<p>So now, I revive that post somewhat in an in-depth appreciation for RSS.</p>
<p>Happy birthday.</p>

<p>I honestly expected this to be A) sooner, and B) before the politics post, but neither happened so here we are.</p>
<p>To start, the blog has been reskinned and the template swapped. The blog should have proper opengraph media previews now! This has been a small but frustrating issue to work through since adding them on bootstrap 4 didn't make them want to play nice with fediverse platforms in particular, and since that's my most likely posting location these days, I wanted them to at least <em>look</em> pretty. It's also <em>much</em> faster since it's not loading a 4k image as the wallpaper (an admittedly rookie mistake), and I'm still thinking about transferring the blog to gitlab or some kind of VPS. This does somewhat mean I need to figure out a new comment system for it, but I'm looking into the viability of the mastodon comments system plugin for Nikola, or the cactus comments system, but I'm not sure how I like having guest accounts comment freely (that typically leads to spam). Or maybe I'll write my own. Who knows. </p>
<p>The major tie-up with the opengraph tags is that I'm more mad that I spent the time on a template, just for a swap to bootblog4 to end up solving most of my issues. I'd like those hours back, please. But no, time moves ever forward. Also I should've just used bootblog4 as a base in the first place, but I digress.</p>

<p>Hello! It's been awhile!</p>
<p>I have plenty to write about but due to certain... aspects of those prospective posts, I wanted to push this one to the front and engage with those aspects somewhat directly in a separate post.</p>
<p>Normally I don't like to shove politics into things, but at this point I feel like having unvoiced opinions is significantly worse than voicing them at all. Given the nature of this election cycle, I find it's important to touch on things leading up to it in an attempt to vocalize how I feel about things, and channel some frustrations. In addition to that fact, my mere existence is political, and whilst I don't think screaming about things endlessly on social media is particularly productive past a certain point, I find that muzzling myself is going to cause more problems than saying anywhere from little to nothing.</p>
<p>Enter: The Trials of the Election Year: A US-centric series of posts talking about policy and the modern body politic, all the way throughout the chain.</p>
<p>Make no mistake: I'm not so deluded as to think that my opinions alone should be the law of the land, I am not a political science major, I am not the standard for everyone, and I am certainly not above critique in any manner. I mostly want to stir conversations that I feel need to be had in order to create and engage in dialogue. I'm also aware that these posts probably won't help me make any friends, but I'm willing to accept that risk. Constructive feedback is welcomed.</p>
<p>This post will primarily cover my observations on social media discourse, particularly in the context of social media, primarily Twitter. If it's not that interesting to you, you can probably skip this one. There's a lot to cover generally, and this one is somewhat banal if for no other reason than to ease into the format. In this instance, it's more anecdotal than future entries will be. A little more casual, if you will.</p>

<p>So, this is it, the end of 2023.</p>
<p>Is that... another post before another month passes us by? Mark <em>that</em> on the calendar. Granted, it's short, but too much of what's been going on has been just terribly mundane. </p>
<p>I have a lot of work ahead of me until New Years' so let me kind of elaborate on the nonsense and we can start working towards the goals, one step at a time.</p>

<p>Autumn's here, and that means it's time to iterate harder.</p>
<p>Typically, I have avoided posting what I do at all outside of a specific thing due to a perceived lack of interest, but Months are actually considerable periods of time when you're doing a lot of waiting, and a lot has been happening recently. From a blog authorship perspective, I'm more realizing at this stage that I just shouldn't care about constantly posting actual interesting things, since that was the pre-switch format in the first place. I simply do not think I'm cut out for content creation in that way. </p>

<p>Finally.</p>
<p>Getting the spare time to write has been generally pretty challenging. Work itself generally eats up my entire weekend, but I actually got out early today. </p>
<p>Working third shift and permanently detonating my sleep schedule has given me a bizzare perspective. I'm one of those people who tends to go on really, <em>really</em> long walks to get some exercise and reset myself, and doing it at three in the morning adds onto the weirdness. Put simply, the world just isn't designed to operate at night. </p>
<p>However, in that silence there are still things that reveal themselves. As an example, I rather like the night sky, what little of it can be seen from my neck of the woods. For a long time, I wished to do astrophotography. </p>
