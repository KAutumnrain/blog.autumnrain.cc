<p>So, this is it, the end of 2023.</p>
<p>Is that... another post before another month passes us by? Mark <em>that</em> on the calendar. Granted, it's short, but too much of what's been going on has been just terribly mundane. </p>
<p>I have a lot of work ahead of me until New Years' so let me kind of elaborate on the nonsense and we can start working towards the goals, one step at a time.</p>

<p>Autumn's here, and that means it's time to iterate harder.</p>
<p>Typically, I have avoided posting what I do at all outside of a specific thing due to a perceived lack of interest, but Months are actually considerable periods of time when you're doing a lot of waiting, and a lot has been happening recently. From a blog authorship perspective, I'm more realizing at this stage that I just shouldn't care about constantly posting actual interesting things, since that was the pre-switch format in the first place. I simply do not think I'm cut out for content creation in that way. </p>

<p>Finally.</p>
<p>Getting the spare time to write has been generally pretty challenging. Work itself generally eats up my entire weekend, but I actually got out early today. </p>
<p>Working third shift and permanently detonating my sleep schedule has given me a bizzare perspective. I'm one of those people who tends to go on really, <em>really</em> long walks to get some exercise and reset myself, and doing it at three in the morning adds onto the weirdness. Put simply, the world just isn't designed to operate at night. </p>
<p>However, in that silence there are still things that reveal themselves. As an example, I rather like the night sky, what little of it can be seen from my neck of the woods. For a long time, I wished to do astrophotography. </p>

<p>The title says it all, basically. I dunno how often these will even be necessary, but I've definitely put myself in a corner with how I'm handling the actual blogging.</p>
<p>Firstly, I'm working on getting my old substack content off of the platform and put here. Once this is done, it'll be under the 'digest-archive' category. It is far
past time I stopped relying on that platform for hosting any of my content. The posts will be properly backdated, and all links will be replaced.</p>
<p>It's been roughly a year since I tried to do a weekly arrangement of interesting things, and since then, 
I've burnt out probably three times over and have gone through multiple life-changing events.  I'm slowly getting my groove properly again, 
but I'm still finding it pretty difficult to do things efficiently as of yet. Recovery has been... challenging. </p>

<p>I tend to say a lot of things.</p>
<p>That might seem like an obvious statement to you, but for those that know me well enough, know generally how I feel about the state of the modern web. I am no stranger to loving <a href="https://converginginterests.substack.com/p/second-simple-syndication">open, interoperable things</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, I will admit that generally hating siloes for merely existing is a bit of an old way of thinking, but the game can only be played for so long, and open solutions to modern technological problems require attention in order to be pushed into usable states. </p>

<p>I've always wanted to make an immersive sim. </p>
<p>Some of my earliest exposures to games when I was young were games like <em>Thief</em> and <em>Deus Ex</em> that emphasized several ways to resolve an obstacle with additional design for large, believable (but not open, in the modern sense) worlds. The challenge, is that usually immersive sims require hundreds of systems to snap into place late in development, and I am one person with extremely limited time and a crippling coffee addiction running on little sleep.</p>
<p>A little while into my first exposure to these kinds of games, I was introduced to Dungeons and Dragons proper after hearing it in passing for a couple years at that point, particularly paired with faint echoes of the satanic panic. Unfortunately, the group fizzled and I had a pretty difficult time getting a group together (Roll20 didn't really exist yet to my knowledge and it certainly wasn't widespread until a hot while later).
My exposure to and interest in TTRPGs up until 2019ish waxed and waned often. I was mostly playing Warhammer 40k until 2015, at which point the game just stopped being fun because of awful players and Games Workshop being generally a nuisance, and thus we swapped to other games like Corvus Belli's Infinity. </p>

<p>Ah. Scope creep rears its ugly head again. Except... it's by design, for some reason.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://kautumnrain.github.io/posts/ramblings-of-a-cryotank/">Previously</a>, I mentioned that there may be a post regarding 'everything apps'. In actuality, I described it using the term 'rant', but I think I can structure this in a way that doesn't require a flow of consciousness.</p>
<p>For starters, I suppose I should mention that I'm not entirely adverse to people and companies trying to do different things in software. My opinion, however, is that an application or script should do at most three things, lest functionality, usability and sanity be sacrificed for an ever-expanding featureset.</p>

    <p>uhhhh whoops! Looks like I accidentally skinned bootstrap4!</p>
<p>I'm absolutely <strong>NOT DONE</strong> with customizing this, but I mostly wanted to
get the theme rolling so I had <em>SOME</em> idea of what I wanted to do. The main
objective to be trying to get somewhat close to <a class="reference external" href="https://kautumnrain.neocities.org">my personal site</a>,
which I'd say the theme is pretty close to.</p>
<p>Next, I'd like to add a sidebar of the most recent posts and an archive
tree. After that, I'm probably done for awhile.</p>
