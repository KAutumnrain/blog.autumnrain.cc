&lt;p&gt;I wanted more posts out more frequently but that sure didn't happen lol. This one's gonna be a bit more rambly so you can probably skip it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be balanced, I am still working on things. My GPU started to eat shit so I had to replace that. Unfortunately, I can't stress it out too hard, as I've realized the horror of having my PC case be too old for modern cooling standards, so &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; I'm doing the whole thing. Fuck it. The unfortunate side effect of this is that I have to wait a little longer to do my art again since I'm waiting on my parts to arrive. As of writing, in November, the GPU is installed, and the CPU and Motherboard are ordered. My case, memory, and cooler will be ordered next paycheck, and storage is on the list as well, but for later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that I'm no longer getting the graphics artifacting and flickering, which tells me that it wasn't just a driver issue, and that the GPU was indeed dying. I will have to change parts of my workflow so the 3D components of the art isn't as intense, which I'm OK with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does mean that all of my major purchases are donezo, for now, and thus I can prepare for school in earnest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I'm out of my depression rut, thanks to a couple of people who are super kind and fun to hang out with (:3), I can look back at the effects objectively; Things are looking up now, but I expect there to be more, lesser roadblocks in the future. That's OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the time period of October 2022-June/July 2023 (and even extending a bit into September), the depression absorbed my entire life, and whilst I could get things done, to say I could function was another thing entirely. Whilst I generally dislike spotify for various reasons, I think my listening time on my wrapped and the scrobbles on last.fm heavily reflect that time period, where I just kinda existed for weeks on end, not really being able to feel, listening to my depression music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That dark time has passed, and my motivation is somewhat returned. I'm still burnt out a little, but I can at least look at code again without wanting to throw up, which is a good sign. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current objectives: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finish infrastructure projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prepare for school&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get some music out at some point&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forge a better future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving on, I will note that my general social media presence is pretty much dead; Obviously I like the fediverse for various reasons, but I struggle to interact with it because I guess I miss having a circle of folks to interact with, which I don't really have anymore as a direct result of Twitter dissipating, in addition to the social anxiety I feel. Overall, however, I still think a protocol is ideal vs a platform when regarding social media. This being said, I will not be touching bluesky, for example, with a ten-foot (≈3m) lead pole, mostly because it's heavily moderation-resistant and also has Jack Dorsey's involvement in some fashion. After everything I've seen, I think I'm OK with avoiding platforms and protocols he's involved in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this to say that I'm trying to post more from here on, I just don't really have the feel for it yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the blog in and of itself, I'm working on a new theme to achieve parity with my main site, but I'm not sure how I want to handle it this time. Skinning bootstrap4 last time was... fine? But it doesn't seem to support the meta tags I need it to, and adding them in is like, somewhat haphazard since I haven't yet found the areas where they even actually get added, which is somewhat frustrating. Solution: develop my own theme; Caveats: time sink. Will have to think about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also I'm a little older now. Weirdly enough, I got a spike of website traffic on my birthday. Not sure what could've caused that. If you're looking at my blog and was a part of that uhhh welcome! and I'd love to hear from you because I'm so confused about where the hitspike came from, and why it was on my birthday of all days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expect a follow up when I'm less rambly :3&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>blog meta</category><category>dev</category><category>ops</category><category>projects</category><guid>https://blog.autumnrain.cc/posts/tmef/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 05 Dec 2023 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Prelude to Synchronization</title><link>https://blog.autumnrain.cc/posts/prelude-to-sync/</link><dc:creator>kat</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Autumn's here, and that means it's time to iterate harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, I have avoided posting what I do at all outside of a specific thing due to a perceived lack of interest, but Months are actually considerable periods of time when you're doing a lot of waiting, and a lot has been happening recently. From a blog authorship perspective, I'm more realizing at this stage that I just shouldn't care about constantly posting actual interesting things, since that was the pre-switch format in the first place. I simply do not think I'm cut out for content creation in that way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The monthly format as of current was actually unintentional: I was between jobs and spiraling pretty hard when I was making those posts. Now the situation has evolved. I am working, but I'm also trying to go back to school, I'm still working on a few projects, and I'm still mostly playing catch-up. My mental energy is definitely pretty low almost all of the time. This being said, however, I believe I have reached a stage where I can start posting somewhat more regularly, even if it's not the most interesting thing in the world. I would generally point out how completely uninteresting I think I am, but I will leave that determination up to the reader. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a fun thing, a couple weeks ago I installed Gentoo on one of my aging laptops and realized the horror and monotony of compiling the GNOME desktop environment on a &lt;a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/95443/intel-core-i57200u-processor-3m-cache-up-to-3-10-ghz/specifications.html"&gt;2C4T chip from seven years ago&lt;/a&gt;. Needless to say, I stopped that after awhile and just went with &lt;a href="https://awesomewm.org/"&gt;Awesome&lt;/a&gt;, which I had never tried before and I actually enjoy using. I've been customizing and configuring the machine between sleep and shifts, so the total amount of time I've thrown into it is like maybe a weekend. Though the machine was practically functional after the first couple hours post-install, it was still super fidgety due to the lack of front-ends and etc. I elected, additionally, to customize the bootloader despite the fact that I find it more or less unnecessary - I had actually never done it before and it was &lt;em&gt;somewhat&lt;/em&gt; painless except for one absolutely annoying thing: grub hates most of the fonts I throw at it, and it looks... dire. I am looking for some fonts to throw at it that aren't totally butchered by &lt;code&gt;grub2-mkfont&lt;/code&gt; but it's frankly been taking more time than I really want to throw at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, I have swapped to &lt;a href="https://opentofu.org/"&gt;OpenTofu&lt;/a&gt; for provisioning now that it's available, and I'm pleased that my previous TF files are just drop-in, for now. I look forward to see where it goes from here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the Gentoo laptop, I had another go at installing OpenBSD on a VM because the last time I did, it was quirky and on hardware that was incredibly aged. This was fine, actually,  but it wasn't really usable as a proper client machine at the time. The main thing I learned from it was that the install is easier than I remember and XFCE is actually super easy to customize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have some things to do, namely some blog customization stuff (I'm trying to figure out a way to add fields in some areas which isn't super hard, but I want it broken out to a markdown meta header...), I have a laptop I'm eyeing to replace my ever-aging Thinkpad T460 as my main "go box" for school, and I'm still dinking around with the Jabber protocol, albeit slowly. I'm also trying to decide whether or not I should make a new theme for both my website and blog (for parity) since it was about this time last year that I updated it. As such, a follow-up will be forthcoming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay warm out there.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>blog meta</category><category>dev</category><category>ops</category><category>projects</category><guid>https://blog.autumnrain.cc/posts/prelude-to-sync/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Oct 2023 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Logical Progression</title><link>https://blog.autumnrain.cc/posts/logical-progression/</link><dc:creator>kat</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;uhhhh whoops! Looks like I accidentally skinned bootstrap4!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm absolutely &lt;strong&gt;NOT DONE&lt;/strong&gt; with customizing this, but I mostly wanted to
get the theme rolling so I had &lt;em&gt;SOME&lt;/em&gt; idea of what I wanted to do. The main
objective to be trying to get somewhat close to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://kautumnrain.neocities.org"&gt;my personal site&lt;/a&gt;,
which I'd say the theme is pretty close to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I'd like to add a sidebar of the most recent posts and an archive
tree. After that, I'm probably done for awhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me know what you think about all of this!&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>blog meta</category><guid>https://blog.autumnrain.cc/posts/logical-progression/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 May 2023 13:34:48 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Blog Changes</title><link>https://blog.autumnrain.cc/posts/blog-changes/</link><dc:creator>kat</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Check this out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed I have swapped out the theme from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://themes.getnikola.com/v8/hack/"&gt;hack&lt;/a&gt; to
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://themes.getnikola.com/v8/bootstrap4/"&gt;bootstrap4&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm doing it mostly for ease of customization,
but it's becoming incredibly clear that I may just have to do a pure overhaul of most themes.
There are huge 'one-liners' of CSS that make it pretty difficult to modify the theme further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, this will be a temporary theme until I have the time and energy to bring things into my personal
spec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automation-wise, I haven't really worked on that yet either, mostly because it's largely dependent on
me settling on a theme, but I might just go ahead and write the pipeline anyhow, since I have to rebuild
the entire project anyways every time I want to post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the theme? Don't care for it? Let me know (mostly because some of this theme might end up in the
real semi-permanent one).&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>blog meta</category><guid>https://blog.autumnrain.cc/posts/blog-changes/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 May 2023 04:34:35 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
